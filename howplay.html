                <p>Now We Flip is the Memory game meets the Rock, Paper, Scissors.</p>
                <p>Each player has 10 cards:</p>
                <img src="" alt="Each player has 10 cards">
                <p>Cards are randomly placed face-down.
                Players take turns, flipping face-up 2 cards at the time, trying to find matching pairs and eliminating other player’s cards in a “Rock, Paper, Scissors” style match.
                </p>
                <p>The matching pair is 2 cards that meet the following conditions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cards are in different colours (red and green).</li>
                    <li>Cards have different symbols (ex. Rock and Paper).</li>
                    <li>None of the cards is an X card.</li>
                </ol>
                <img src="" alt="Example of a matching pair">
                <p>2 cards that don’t meet the above conditions is called a neutral pair.</p>
                <img src="" alt="Examples of neutral pairs">
                <p>Flipping the matching card pair makes the 2 cards battle and the winning card is determined according to the “Rock, Paper, Scissors” rules (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, Paper beats Rock).
                The winning card stays in the game, the loosing card is removed. In case of neutral card pair there is a draw and both cards stay in the game.
                </p>
                <p>When an active player flips a matching pair of cards and their card is the loosing card - that card is still removed from the game.
                Therefore players need to be careful on their turns, not to draw a loosing pair.
                On their turn players can flip only 2 cards. Player’s turn does not continue after successfully finding a winning pair.
                </p>
                <p>The player panel helps to keep track of the cards lost by each player.</p>
